# Matrix-Math-Library
A simple library to store matrices and handle matrix math operations

## Introduction
This is a simple math library to store matrices and handle common matrix operations.

## Usage
A new matrix object can be made as follows: 

`let m = new Matrix(rows,cols);`

It takes 2 parameters:

`rows`: The number of rows in the matrix. (Number)

`cols`: The number of columns in the matrix. (Number)

By default, the matrix has all elements as 0. To specify the matrix, use `m.matrix` property. For example,

```
let m = new Matrix(2,2);
m.matrix = [
            [5,8]
            [9,10]
           ];
```
The documentation is being updated. Soon, the complete reference will be uploaded to know about all the methods available.
